## Introduction

Environmental Sensors from Texas Instruments are specialized sensors used across the industry from Personal Electronics to Medical Devices. These sensors come in a variety of interface types such as I2C (most common), I3C (coming soon), UART, SPI, Analog, Single-Wire and more. These sensors are typically integrated in systems using MCUs to read, interpret and react to measurements read from environmental sensors.

This repository contains a collection of firmware ranging from simple Arduino sample codes to in-depth drivers to provide engineers with an easy design and implementation process.

## Repo Organization
Devices which currently have code examples can be found in the main /devices folder. Inside, subfolders distinguish sensors from their type (digital-local, humidity, etc.). Example code will primarily be in Arduino. Additionally, some devices may include complete Arduino driver code with appropriate header and main files. This list is always updating so check back regularly or reach out to us for a specific device!`
